          <p>Hi there.</p>
          <p>My name is Sipho Gcelu. I've lived all my life in Cape Town, I went to my Primary and High school here.</p>
          <p>I'm an artist/musician. I started playing piano and drums in 2009, and then the bass guitar in 2013. I have passion for music and I listen, almost, to every genre that is there; Jazz, Gospel, RnB, Hip Hop, Kwaito, etc.</p>
          <p>Either than that, professionally, I am a Web/Software developer and I work for CodeSpace Academy.
